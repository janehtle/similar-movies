# NPM Packages Installed
1. Express - for handling server and routes
2. postman-request - for making HTTP requests to TMDb API
3. nodemon - auto restart when files change, installed as a dev dependency instead of dependency since I'm only using this during development, not production. This application doesn't need nodemon to run (production), or at least that's how I'm trying to make it be as I work on this.
4. dotenv - to load TMDb API key from .env file securely 
*(NEVER HARD CODE API KEY!!)
